During university I took a class on Adobe Illustrator and used a textbook that explained how to use the program through a series of follow-along lessons. In theory this sounds great, but in practice it was anything but.

Problem was, the book covered the technical aspects of using the tools but never explained how to use them to create compelling vector graphics. Frankly, if I’d submitted the end result from their tutorials in my graphic design class I’d received an F! Clearly there was a big gap between knowing the tools (many of them I later find out are never even used by professional designers!) and actually being able to use them well.

In all the ways that book failed, vector basic training succeeds. It teaches how to use the core vector building tools and most importantly, a repeatable methodology for building beautiful and clean professional-grade designs. Von even includes accompanying screencasts and build files from *client-projects! *This was such a helpful book for me and I’d totally recommend it to others.
