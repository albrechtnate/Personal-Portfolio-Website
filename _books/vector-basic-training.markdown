The class I took on [Illustrator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Illustrator) in college used a textbook that explained how to use the program through follow-along lessons. In theory this sounds great, but in practice it was anything but.

Problem was, the book covered how to use the tools but never how to use them *to create compelling vector graphics.* Frankly, if I’d submitted the end result from their tutorials in my graphic design class I’d have received an F! Clearly there was a big gap between knowing the tools and actually being able to use them well.

In all the ways that book failed, vector basic training succeeds. It teaches how to use the core vector building tools and more importantly, a repeatable methodology for building beautiful and clean professional designs. Von even includes accompanying *screencasts* and *build files* from *client-projects!* This is such a helpful book—totally recommend reading it.
