This book really is fun like the title says! The book is written for absolute beginners—adults who haven’t drawn since middle school and “aren’t talented.” Kistler makes things so simple that anyone can follow along. This isn’t one of those “draw a rectangle, draw a circle, \[missing steps 3-100\], and now you have a realistic-looking tiger.”

I’ve never been a fine artist, so I’m glad that realistic drawing isn’t a key skill for designers. That said, it is helpful if a designer can at least sketch out their ideas. Even rough sketches can really help while working in software.

This is my favorite resource to learn how to draw. Take each chapter one day at a time, be inspired, explore your own ideas, and just enjoy the process!
