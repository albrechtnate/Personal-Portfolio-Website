If there’s a big idea this book drives home, it’s this: *A brand is a whole lot more than just a pretty logo.** ***A brand is what an organization values and how it presents itself to others.

*Designing Brand Identity* focuses primarily on brand strategy. Big ideas, mission statements, and taglines. It discusses brand architecture, acquisitions, and how to maintain a consistent voice and CX. On visual identity, it discusses the pros and cons of different types of marks, color, typography, motion, brand standards manuals, and touchpoints like packaging, signage, vehicle graphics, and print collateral.

The book isn’t fun reading—it’s like a glossary filled with fluffy quotes and *lots* of case studies—but it does provide a great 1000-foot view of branding.
