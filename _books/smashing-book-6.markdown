The Smashing series continues with *New Frontiers in Web Design*. Structured like others in the series: distinct chapters by distinct authors around a central theme. It *feels like* Smashing’s best articles handpicked and expanded. (Not a bad thing!)

Topics include advocating a design system, using CSS custom properties, loading assets quickly, and designing conversational UIs. At first it seemed too diverse, but these *are* the “new frontier” issues …even 2 years later when I read it. Naturally I was more interested in certain topics, but I liked that the diversity made me consider areas I was less inclined towards.

Disappointingly, the material didn’t seem actionable on *my* real-life projects. I’m not doing VR or chatbots—even the performance chapter, while interesting, wasn't actionable. I guess that’s the nature of “new frontiers”. [The last chapter](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2018/06/bringing-personality-back-to-the-web), however, was so applicable and inspiring! Also, did I mention, the printed book is a beaut!
