Smashing Magazine continues their Smashing Books series with *New Frontiers in Web Design*, which is quite aptly titled. It’s structured like others in the series: a collection of distinct chapters, by distinct authors, around a central theme. The chapters are entirely original, but it feels like Smashing’s best articles hand-picked, edited, and expanded. (Which isn’t a bad thing!)

Topics include advocating a design system, effectively using CSS Custom Properties, a deep dive into performant loading, and creating conversational UIs. At first they seemed too diverse, but in context of “New Frontier” they really do represent the cutting-edge issues in the industry… even 2 years after publication when I read it. Naturally I was interested in certain topics over others, but I liked that the diverse content made me consider areas of the industry I was less familiar or inclined towards.

I was disappointed that the material didn’t seem very applicable to *my* real-life current projects. I’m not doing VR or making Chatbots—even the performance chapter, while interesting, didn’t seem applicable. But I guess that’s the nature of “new frontiers”… The last chapter, “Bring Personality Back to the Web”, however was very applicable and fantastic. Triggered so much good brainstorming. Whole book would be worth it just for that one chapter. Also, did I mention—this book is a beaut!
