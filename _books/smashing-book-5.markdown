*Smashing Book 5* is an interesting book. First off, it’s huge. Secondly, it’s *beautiful*—probably the best produced book I own. But most importantly, it has loads of practical chapters written by different industry experts.

While each of the chapters cover very different topics ranging from the nuances of SVG and web fonts to structured content and the nightmare that is responsive HTML email—they are all united by a common theme: How do we design complex websites in the age of RWD?

The book may lose its significance as the patterns and practices in it become commonplace, but until then, this compendium will benefit any practitioner of the web. (Besides, it’s a great way to support SmashingMag!)
