I read Shape Up while at Fontspring after my project manager and technical lead read it and began referring to its terminology in meetings. The [free ebook](https://basecamp.com/shapeup) describes a set of project management practices Basecamp uses to build the most important work quickly while eliminating uncertainty. Due my team’s small size it’s imperative we work on the right things; we simply don’t have the time for distractions. However, often scope would creep, side projects would distract, and project timelines would blow past estimates.

The book’s main idea is to fit the work into six weeks. Rather than estimate how long a project might take, you “hammer” its scope so that you can have something meaningful to deploy after the six week “cycle”.

We decided to try this at Fontspring. At the time of writing we’ve completed only one cycle. We have areas to improve in but it’s been helpful. The hard deadlines can certainly be frustrating and stressful, but I for one especially appreciate the clear goals and deadlines.
