I read *Shape Up* after my managers at Fontspring read it and began referring to its terminology in meetings. [The free ebook](https://basecamp.com/shapeup) describes the project management techniques Basecamp uses to build the most important work quickly while eliminating uncertainty.

The book’s main idea is to fit the work into six weeks. Rather than estimate how long a project might take, you “hammer” its scope so that something meaningful can be deployed after six weeks.

My team is small so it’s vital we work on the right things; yet too often side projects and scope creep distracted our focus causing delays. At the time of writing we’ve completed one cycle and it’s been helpful. The deadlines can be frustrating, but I find the clear goals and dates invaluable for staying focused.
