This is an excellent text on how to do typography well on the web. Dozens of good typography resources exist, but in my opinion, this one does a better job than most at explaining how to set type well.

The book includes theory, but it mainly focuses on application. You won’t find a long list of glyph anatomy (not that learning this isn’t valuable), but you will learn how to look at type. You’ll start to see the minute differences between Georgia and Chaparral, and know when to choose which and why.

The book’s coverage of the unique challenges of web typography (RWD, justification, font rendering, and font loading…) sets it apart from similar texts. This is an insightful book for all, especially new typesetters!
