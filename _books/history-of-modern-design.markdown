Some themes and tensions of design—such as craft versus mass-production or the value of ornamentation—have existed for centuries and continue in some form today.

Raziman’s *History of Modern Design* dives into how these themes played out over history and influenced architecture, industrial design, fashion, typography, and graphic design.

Unfortunately the book is long and at times stale. Little of the book is devoted specifically to graphic design. However, it succeeds in providing a context for design history as a whole and is a great supplement to Megg’s History of Graphic Design.
