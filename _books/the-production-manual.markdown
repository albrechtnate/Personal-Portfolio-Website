I got this book for my Graphic Design II course in college. When I began it, I was focused on UI/UX and uninterested in print design. By the end, I was so excited by the possibilities of print design that I wanted to do more of it!

The first two chapters are skippable; there are better resources to learn typography and image manipulation. The following four chapters are more interesting. You’ll learn about color reproduction, dpi/ppi/spi, overprinting, trapping, proofs, halftones, paper, foils, die cutting, varnishes, folding, binding, and a whole lot more!

If you’re already familiar with print production you likely won’t learn anything new, but if you were a novice like I was, you’ll learn quite a bit.
