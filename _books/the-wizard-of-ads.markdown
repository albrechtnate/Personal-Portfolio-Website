My CEO recommended *The Wizard of Ads* to me after I recommended *Selling the Invisible* to him. There’s three sections each with about three dozen “chapters” (a page or two) consisting of an anecdote and an insight to glean.

The first section is on marketing your company and writing successful ad copy. It warns you of wasting too much time trying to find the “right people” and instead encourages you to spend that time saying the “right thing.”

Section two contains anecdotes about how to run a business and how *not* to. And section three is mainly life advice: do what you love, seize opportunity, celebrate the ordinary, set milestones and have dreams but don't make your happiness dependent on them, and marry your best friend.

The stories are interesting, the book is inspiring, and the principles will serve as guiding lights for me, but don’t expect to find explicit practical tips.
