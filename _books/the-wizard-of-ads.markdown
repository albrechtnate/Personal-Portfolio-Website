My CEO recommended *The Wizard of Ads* to me after I recommended *Selling the Invisible* to him. There’s three sections each with about three dozen “chapters” (a page or two) consisting of an anecdote and an insight to glean.

The first section is on marketing your company and writing successful ad copy. It warns you of wasting time finding “the right people” and instead encourages you to spend that time saying “the right thing.”

Section two contains anecdotes about how to run a business and how *not* to. And section three is mainly life advice: do what you love; seize opportunity; celebrate the ordinary; set goals but don't depend on them for happiness; marry your best friend. The book is inspiring, the stories compelling, and the principles exemplary—just don’t expect explicit practical tips here.
