Twenty Bits is a delightful little book by the delightful Dan Cederholm who is well-known within the design community for, among other things, co-founding [Dribbble.com](https://dribbble.com).

After being a bit burnt-out from reading other long technical books, I was hoping for a quick and easy read, and that’s exactly what this is. Seriously, I read from cover to cover in a single sitting one evening. But despite the thin profile, it contains great bits of wisdom from Dan’s experiences as a designer, entrepreneur, and all-around creative individual.

Some bits of advice that especially connected with me were, *“Persistent iteration over flashy launches”* and, *“Not knowing what you’re doing Is okay.”* Both I frankly know intellectually, but are hard to internalize. Hearing and being reminded of these truths from other’s perspectives is so valuable to me.

Of course, the book has fun accompanying illustrations and the physical production quality is excellent. I’d expect nothing less from Dan. Highly recommend!
