We intuitively know when something’s poorly designed, but it can be hard to put into words why. Don Norman, the inventor of the term “user experience”, introduces affordances, signifiers, and conceptual models to help explain it.

Norman shows that design (good and bad) is *everywhere:* door handles, faucets, tea kettles… The book focuses on simple physical objects, but the principles are equally applicable to complex digital interfaces.

You’ll find this book on just about any UX recommended reading list, and for good reason. If you read this book with an open mind you’ll likely walk away with not just new knowledge, but a new perspective on the world.
