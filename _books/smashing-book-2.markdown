One of the most well-respected publications for the web industry and one of my favorite blogs to read, Smashing Magazine, regularly publishes the “Smashing Book”. They commission and compile loads of quality content about contemporary web topics by respected professionals. I love their books because the content is always so practical!

The content within this book covers the principles of graphic design, mobile app design, web typography, gamification in UX (I especially enjoyed this chapter), and psychology. I love the diversity of topics, but it does seem disjointed—almost like reading a bunch of different blog posts.

I read the book about 5 years after publication and parts of it were already out-of-date. I like their later editions better, but this was still a good read!
