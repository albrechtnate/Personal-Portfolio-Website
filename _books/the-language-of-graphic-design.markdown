I have a fondness for this book because it was my first graphic design book ever. It systematically walks through the Elements of Art (the letters and words) and Principles of Design (the grammar and syntax).

Each chapter defines an element or principle and its characteristics (line can organize or divide, can be actual or implied…).

I most enjoyed the inspiring examples. They showed how the same element could create vastly different images and moods, as well as exposed me to the most iconic works of design history for the first time.

The book seems so simple, and it is, but it’s also so valuable. I wish every new designer would read this one, they would benefit from its instruction.
