The title’s surprising. Steal?! I thought artists were to create visionary, original works—not imitate and rip-off others. Janda compellingly argues that nothing is original, all creators steal from their influences. Good artists transform their thefts, while bad artists simply imitate them.

Steal Like an Artist is just the first point of the book, however. With succinct copy that makes it seem as if the author is speaking directly to you, Janda gives other tips on how to be creative:

Keep learning. Carry a notebook. Don’t wait until you know who you are, show up and create. Use your hands. Have side projects & hobbies. Surround yourself with things and people you love. Be nice. Keep a praise file. Be boring. Write. *Do good work and share it.* (among many others.)

It’s hard not to come away feeling inspired. This is a real good one.
