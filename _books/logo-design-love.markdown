*Logo Design Love* pulls back the curtain behind the process of creating creative and impactful logos. With simple yet friendly prose, David explains how to acquire good clients, conduct brand research, develop concepts, render them, and present the work to clients.

Airey proposes that an iconic logo must be simple, relevant, distinct, memorable, and versatile. A good logo outlives design trends and above all has a concept that focuses on *one* thing. Case studies accompany each of these principles to take them from abstract  to concrete.

This is a very practical book that goes beyond talking about creating logos to discuss the entire creative process, including tips to stay motivated and deal with tricky clients. Highly recommended regardless of specialization.
