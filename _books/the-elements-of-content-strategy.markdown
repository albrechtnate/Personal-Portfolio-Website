Erin Kissane’s *The Elements of Content Strategy* is a good intro to content strategy (CS). Like all A Book Apart publications, the depth of content far exceeds the book’s slim profile. This book will get you up to speed with the tools to create and manage better content without wasting your time.

I don’t intend to become a CS specialist, but given that few projects have one, it’s worth having some background. I started the book with the notion that CS was copywriting, but was quickly corrected. In fact, “content strategy is to copywriting as information architecture is to design”!

Kissane describes good content and how to use tools like content templates & audits. Her section on the four influences (Editor, Marketer, Curator, and Info Scientist) was particularly helpful. A valuable read!
