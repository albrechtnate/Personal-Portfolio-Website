Whether we’re marketing a product, trying to sell a client on our concept, or create change in our organization, we all want our ideas to stick. Our ideas often seem to go in one ear and out the other—or worse: our audience connects with the idea, but it fails to create lasting impact and is forgotten.

The Heath brothers propose that the degree to which an idea “sticks” isn’t as random as it seems. They propose a framework for creating sticky ideas: **S**imple, **U**nexpected, **C**oncrete, **C**redible, and **E**motional **S**torie**s**.

The book itself follows the brothers’ advice, and is filled with rich, memorable stories that help bring the principles to life. Sure it’s entertaining, but the value come from practicing the principles they preach. I think *anyone*, regardless of their role, could make their ideas stickier.
