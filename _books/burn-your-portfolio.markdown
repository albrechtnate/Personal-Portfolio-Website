Burn Your Portfolio is what every book should strive to be—packed full of valuable content, coherently structured, easily readable (even humorous), and well-designed.

We designers like to talk design (fonts, colors, grids, software), not business (clients, project management, networking, and contracts). But to be a designer is to work for clients, so to be a great designer we have to work well with them. This book teaches you how to do that.

It’s broken into 111 “chapters”, often only 1–3 pages, and reads almost like a daily devotional. Janda allows unprecedented insight into client management, frequently citing specific dollar figures and providing his own agency’s email templates for the reader’s own use.

This book won’t be far from reach—I’ll be referencing it again and again.
