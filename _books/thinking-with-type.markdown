All real designers love typefaces, so naturally they’ll all enjoy the history of the beloved classics and the type samples found in *Thinking with Type.*

If you’re just starting to learn typography, you’ll get a lot out of this book. It’ll introduce you to most of the key concepts you need to know. If you’re familiar with the subject, you won’t find much new material here, but I think you’ll still enjoy it. This was the case when I read it. Even though most of the content was repeat information, I still enjoyed reading it.

The “Type Crime” notes are especially helpful. They’re simple tips that will quickly and substantially improve your typography. The book also has a great section on grids. If you want to be a designer you *need* to learn typography. You certainly can’t go wrong with this manual.
