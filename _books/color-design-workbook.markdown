Remember painting the color wheel in art class? There’s yellow, orange, red, purple, blue, green, and all other the ones in-between. That’s all there is to color, right? Wrong.

Color is a deep topic—it’s a complicated amalgamation of physics, psychology, computer science, and art. I’ve read dozens of articles to understand it better and am still often confused. To add to the struggle, misinformation runs rampant.

Fortunately, the *Color Design Workbook* exists. It’s accurate in the details (which you think would be a given, but apparently it’s not) and comprehensively covers the topic without getting too far in the weeds. It’s well-designed & colorful (duh) and contains case studies, color harmonies, and color meanings. 2 negatives: It doesn’t cover color management & profiles and it’s not a workbook. Still, it’s a great book!
