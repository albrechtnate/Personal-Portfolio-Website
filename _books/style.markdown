I wish I read this book and learned it’s principles for writing clearly earlier. Perhaps if I had, I wouldn’t have conditioned myself to spend twenty words saying what could be said in ten. This habit of writing verbosely was handy for school papers, but the real-world likes concision. People are too busy for fluff. Whether I’m emailing clients or writing web copy, I need to communicate clearly and professionally.

Williams cares about good writing, not the “rules of grammar.” He tells you to write with subjects and actions, get to the main verb quickly, and place new info at the end of the sentences, among other principles.

Until I can instill these principles in to my stream-of-consciousness writing this book will be by my side. I highly recommend everyone get this book.
