HTML5 for Web Designers was the first book in the A Book Apart series that I ever got. It’s essentially a transition guide for developers used to writing XHTML to get up to speed on HTML5. The book *could* also be used as an introduction to HTML itself, but because it assumes some previous knowledge and is written to the industry professional I wouldn’t recommend it.

The content in this book is good and isn’t necessarily out-of-date, it’s just not needed any longer. For it’s time, the book must have been great and super helpful. All developers write in HTML5 now though, so a transition guide simply isn’t needed. A Book Apart did release a second edition in 2016 that *may* have made it more relevant. The first edition is available for free online at [https://html5forwebdesigners.com](https://html5forwebdesigners.com)
