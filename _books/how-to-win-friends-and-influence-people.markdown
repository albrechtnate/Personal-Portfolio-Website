*How to Win Friends and Influence People* was published in 1936 and has sold over 30 million copies! Given this legacy—along with the fact that I’m a total introvert and am painfully awkward at maintaining conversations—I figured I’d see what this book had for me.

A maxim frequented in the book is that “a human’s deepest desire is to feel *important*.” Carnegie’s entire premise can be summarized as, “do that which bolsters other’s sense of importance and abstain from anything that’d tarnish it. For example, “give sincere appreciation” and “don’t criticize or complain.”

Honestly, the book wasn’t what I expected—it seemed to focus on business salesmanship, which is less relevant to me. It’s filled with stories, but in my opinion little “meat.” It’s disorganized and repetitive. Skip it, but ruminate on [the principles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/How_to_Win_Friends_and_Influence_People#Fundamental_Techniques_in_Handling_People). They’re solid and cover the book, just in fewer words.
