*How to Win Friends and Influence People* has been around since 1936 and sold over 30 million copies! Based on this legacy—along with the fact that I’m a total introvert and am painfully awkward at starting and maintaining conversation
s—I figured I’d see what this book had for me.

A maxim frequented in the book is that “a human’s deepest desire is to feel *important*.” Carnegie’s entire premise can be summarized as, “do that which bolsters other’s sense of importance and abstain from anything that’d tarnish it. For example, “give sincere appreciation” and “don’t criticize or complain.”

Honestly, the book wasn’t what I expected—it seemed to focus on business salesmanship, which is less relevant to me. It’s packed with stories, but in my opinion, has little “meat.” Overall, it felt disorganized and repetitive.

I wouldn’t suggest this one, but I do believe there’s something to get out of every book. Ruminate on a [summary of the principles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/How_to_Win_Friends_and_Influence_People#Fundamental_Techniques_in_Handling_People). They’re solid and cover what the book has to offer.
