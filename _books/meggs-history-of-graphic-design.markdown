There’s simply no better introduction to the past design ideologies and designers that shaped our industry. 

Condensing this rich history without it becoming dry is difficult. Megg succeeds by creating an engaging narrative rather than simply listing dates and names. At 624 pages (prehistory–early-21st century) it’s by no means a short read, but the prose is easily digestible.

I especially enjoyed viewing the change of style over time through the many color photographs. I perceive frequently referring back to this book for inspiration, especially when becoming sick of current design trends.
