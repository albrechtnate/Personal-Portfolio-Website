Drawing ideas is an attractive book full of fascinating illustrations and ideas on how to create low-fidelity explanatory sketches. The book has a strong bent towards industrial (product) design and “sketchnoting.” The authors impress on the reader the need to keep sketches loose and fast.

This book won’t help you draw a realistic-looking person. But it will help you quickly draw something that communicates the idea of a person. You’ll see through example how to draw waypoints, flowcharts, and callout arrows to make your sketches easier to understand.

If you want to learn how to be a better illustrator or learn how to sketch interfaces, than this probably isn’t the one for you. But if you want to learn how to use sketching during brainstorming, then this is the book for you.
