*Making and Breaking the Grid* is one of the better books I’ve read on grids. I appreciate that it teaches the concepts and the historical context surrounding its use (or lack thereof) without imposing an unnecessary moral judgement (unlike most Modernist literature on the topic).

Through his writing and curation Samara fosters empathy for both rational and intuitive layout methods. Each project is unique and might lend itself to either method, and each designer should be free to use the appropriate tools.

I personally enjoyed the deconstruction section. I wasn’t familiar with the style and was initially skeptical of its merit, so I was glad to discover a newfound appreciation by the end of the book.

Note: It’s *not* a “Layout Workshop”. I’m not sure why that’s in the title?
