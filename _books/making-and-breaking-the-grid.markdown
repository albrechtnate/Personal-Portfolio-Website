*Making and Breaking the Grid* is one of the best books I’ve read on grids. I appreciate that it teaches its concepts and historical context surrounding its use (or lack thereof) without imposing an unnecessary moral judgement (unlike most Modernist literature on the topic).

Through writing and curation Samara fosters empathy for both rational and intuitive layout methods. Each project is unique and may lend itself to either method. Designers should feel free to use the appropriate tool.

I personally enjoyed the deconstruction section. I wasn’t familiar with the style and was skeptical of its merit, so I was glad to discover a newfound appreciation by the end of the book.

Note: It’s *not* a “Layout Workshop”. I’m not sure why that’s in the title?
