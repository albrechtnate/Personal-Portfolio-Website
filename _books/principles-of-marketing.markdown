I used this book in my Principles of Marketing class in university. The book is by Philip Kotler, who is considered the “father of modern marketing” by those in the marketing industry. The lengthy book discusses the entire marketing process—topics such as developing your product, business life-cycle stages, pricing strategies, supply chain logistics, and advertising.

The book is definitely written as your standard textbook. By that I mean much of the content is definitions and the tone of voice is distinctly academic. It’s not a book that you would necessarily enjoy reading, but it is full of informative content. Before reading this book I had no idea that so many disciplines fell under the umbrella of marketing. Marketing is a whole lot more than just company communications! Overall, this is a decent resource if you’re interested in learning about what marketers focus on.
