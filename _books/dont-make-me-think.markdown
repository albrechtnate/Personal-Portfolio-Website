Steve Jobs once said that “design is not just what it looks like and feels like. Design is how it works.” *Don’t Make Me Think* helps foster this mindset that is so critical for creating effective interactive experiences.

In the book, Steve Krug explains web usability in a way anyone can understand. Usability is about something being so simple that it just seems like common sense. The user shouldn’t have to think about what they’re doing, the interface should fade away and *just work.*

Krug presents 7 questions to measure usability: is it useful, is it learnable, is it memorable, is it effective, is it efficient, is it desirable, and is it delightful. This framework and other insightful notes, all presented in Krug’s accessible and casual style, makes this book an essential read.
