What’s better than reading a book written by *the authority* on the subject? That’s what *Content Strategy for the Web* by Kristina Halvorson from Brain Traffic is. This is an essential handbook for wrestling back control of your content to create some sense of order.

One of the best parts of this book is the “Content Strategy Quad” she developed that explains the discipline. The core is “Core Content Strategy,” which defines how an organization uses content to achieve its objectives and meet user needs. The left half of the quad describes the content components: “Substance” (Developing the content and messages) and “Structure” (IA & Taxonomy). The right half describes the people components: “Workflow” (Processes to create and maintain content) and “Governance” (Key decision makers and content owners). 

This is essential reading IMO, and one you’ll want to hold on to.
