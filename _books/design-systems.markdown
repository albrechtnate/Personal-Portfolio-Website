I suppose there’s no higher for a praise for a book than one that transforms your mindset towards a subject. Well, that’s what *Design Systems* from Alla Kholmatova did for me regarding design systems.

If I was asked to build a design system I’d jump to the tangible artifacts: an interface inventory and pattern library. These tools can provide us a shared set of patterns, but Alla compellingly shows that a shared set of patterns is useless without a shared *understanding* of the patterns.

A few takeaways: Creating a design *system* is far more about orchestrating systems-thinking than designing specific tangible artifacts. Establishing clear, actionable, &  brand-specific shared design principles (like “direction over choice”) are foundational as is  a shared language. What you name a component can be as important as the component itself. Lastly and most importantly, simply listing the components is insufficient—you must guide design system consumers about when & why they should use a specific component. For example, don’t just list all your colors but describe the purpose of each color.

A very well-written book backed by exhaustive research… I’ll certainly be re-reading this on my next design systems project.
