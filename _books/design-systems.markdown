I suppose there’s no higher for a praise for a book than one that transforms your mindset towards a subject. Well, that’s what *Design Systems* did for me regarding design systems. If I was asked to build a design system I’d immediately jump to the tangible artifacts: an interface inventory and pattern library. These tools can provide us a shared set of patterns, but Alla compelling shows that a shared set of patterns is useless without a shared *understanding* of how to use the patterns. Creating a design *system* is far more about designing a system of designing than specific tangible artifacts. Major takeaways:

* Establishing clear and actionable brand-specific shared design principles (like “direction over choice”) are foundational for any successful design system.

* Shared language is critical. What you name a component (and reaching consensus across all teams about that name) is as important as the component itself. It can even hint at the acceptable uses of the component.

* Simply listing the components is insufficient—you must guide design system consumers about when/why you should use a specific component. For example, don’t just list all your colors but describe the purpose of each color.

I loved the distinction between “functional patterns” and “perceptual patterns” presented in the book. I will definitely be re-reading this book the next time I work on a design systems project. This book is well researched and written—I hope to read more from Alla Kholmatova in the future.
