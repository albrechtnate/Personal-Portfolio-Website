Lighting design is as much technology as it is art. This text I used in my college lighting design class respects that and covers both *very* well. I was so impressed with its breadth and depth. As an industry-outsider and noob, this book was beyond helpful!

It begins with the controllable qualities of light used to evoke particular emotions or achieve particular goals, followed by later chapters on the design process and using a lighting key.

Then it explains the different types of lighting instruments, lenses, lamps, cables, dimmers, and consoles; covering both new and old methods (which is good since venues can be slow to upgrade.) Thereâ€™s even a whole chapter on electrical theory! The last chapters focus on drafting light plots and other documentation to better communicate your designs to others. A\+ book.
