While interning with Fontspring I was tasked with redesigning their homepage. The existing homepage promoted a few of the best fonts in their catalogue, but it lacked in its ability to communicate to visitors why they should buy the fonts from Fontspring as opposed to another distributor. I began the project by interviewing a number of the stakeholders in this project to understand what they hoped the new homepage would accomplish. I read user feedback and studied any patterns that existed in our analytics data.

After several rounds of sketches, designs, and feedback the company landed on a design that would meet our objectives. The new homepage contained much more content to give site visitors a fuller picture of who Fontspring is and what they have to offer. In particular, font sliders were created to allow users to keep exploring new fonts for essentially forever.

After writing the content, designing the pages, and coding the front-end, I created a custom server side AB Testing system that would allow us to test the new homepage against the old, and do a controlled rollout. After a few weeks of data gathering, the results we saw were positive, so we executed the complete rollout of the new design.
