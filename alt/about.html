		<h1>About</h1>
		<h2>Who are you?</h2>
		<p>I&rsquo;m an interactive experience designer from the Philadelphia region, currently at Cedarville University in Cedarville, Ohio.</p>
		<p>Personalitywise, I&rsquo;m an <a href="https://www.16personalities.com/intj-personality">INTJ</a>. As such, I value organization, alone time, and logical thinking. I&rsquo;m grateful to possess organizational skills and a detail-oriented approach as natural strengths.</p>
		<p>I also tend to be more reflective than vocal, which means I&rsquo;m careful with what I say, but can also overthink things and lack spotaneity. To improve in this area I&rsquo;ve sought out several situations that force me to become more forward.</p>
		<p>Leadership doesn&rsquo;t come to me naturally either, as I&rsquo;d rather be in the background than sharing my vision with others. Fortunately, leadership roles in Boy Scouts and college have helped me learn to how lead well.</p>
		<p>My Christian faith is the most imporant factor in who I am. I won&rsquo;t be prosletyzing or perfect, but I will live in light of the new life I&rsquo;ve been called to as I pursue my King.</p>
		<h2>Why Design?</h2>
		<p>Art and technology <a href="#">have always interested me</a>, but it wasn&rsquo;t until I learned about design that I found my true passion.</p>
		<p>Many areas of design excite me, but interactive design stands out because it enables me to use technology to execute a design vision, and use design to impact real people.</p>
		<h2>Education</h2>
		<p>In May 2019 I will gradaute with a <em>Bachelors of Arts in Visual Communication Design</em> concentrated in <em>Interactive Web Design</em> from <a href="https://www.cedarville.edu/Academic-Programs/Visual-Communication-Design-Interactive-Web.aspx">Cedarville University</a>.</p>
		<p>For a broader skillset, I also took minors in Graphic Design and Bible and elective classes in:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Motion graphics</li>
			<li>3D computer graphics</li>
			<li>Stage lighting design</li>
			<li>Content strategy</li>
			<li>Marketing</li>
		</ul>
		<p>During the course of my studies I enjoyed the ability to serve as the <a href="https://www.aiga.org/">AIGA</a>/<a href="http://cscarts.org/">CSCA</a> student group President. I planned trips to local industry events which included lectures by highly-regarded designers and an agency tour.</p>
		<p>I was also involved on the Student Government marketing committee my Sophmore and Junior years, and a member of The STUDIOâ€”my University&rsquo;s Art and Design organization.</p>
		<h2>Work Experiences</h2>
		<p>I&rsquo;ve had the pleasure of working with several groups over the past few years. The diverse roles have afforded me the ability to learn new job responsibilities quickly, while also giving me experience working in vastly different team enviorments.</p>
		<p>Currently I&rsquo;m working as the Student Government Association Marketing Director for the Campus Experience Department at Cedarville University.</p>

		<h2>Interests and Activities</h2>
		<p>I appreicate a balance between work and personal life, and believe my interests outside interactive design help bring a more creative perspective to my work.</p>

		</ul>
