# What podcasts do you listen to and recommend?

Podcasts are the *best.*

* They’re absolutely free.

* You can easily fit them into your daily schedule. I listen while doing chores or driving (don’t try that with reading!)

* They’re entertaining and informative.

* They share new perspectives on familiar topics or sometimes even introduce you to something entirely new.

* …and they keep you feeling inspired and refreshed, realigning your vision on the things that truly matter.

Overall, they’re just great for keeping your mind engaged when you’re tired of music. I listen to an episode almost every morning. I’m not a morning person, so it’s a nice way to ease into the day.

## My Ten Favorite Podcasts

In no particular order, these are my favorite podcasts. The content and format vary, but they’re all great shows. Maybe you’ll find a new favorite from this list, but if not, at least now you know what’s playing in my earbuds!

*Note: I’ve limited the selection to podcasts that are currently active. This list is dynamic, and will be updated as needed.*

### 1. [Design Life](https://www.designlife.fm)

Design Life features casual conversations between [Charli Prangley](https://charlimarie.com) and [Femke van Schoonhoven](https://www.femke.co.nz) about life as a designer. I appreciate their transparency about the challenges creatives face. A favorite episode is [Episode 38: Jack of all trades - Specialist or generalist?](https://www.designlife.fm/episode/38)

### 2. [Overtime](https://dribbble.com/overtime)

Overtime is the official podcast of [Dribbble](https://dribbble.com). The podcast reports and comments on trending design news and features thoughts from well-know designers. I personally preferred previous host Dan Cedarholm’s style, but fortunately he’s started [a new podcast](https://show.simplebits.com), so it’s really a win-win. I particularly enjoyed Dan’s discussion in [Episode 56 with Meagan Fisher](https://dribbble.com/overtime/2019/04/10/owltastic-s-meagan-fisher-on-adapting-to-the-modern-landscape-of-web-design).

### 3. [The Seanwes Podcast](https://seanwes.com/podcast)

I first discovered Sean through his [stunning lettering art](https://dribbble.com/shots/880418-Just-a-friendly-nudge), but I’ve stuck around for his clear advice on creativity, business, and personal development. The Seanwes podcast always leaves you inspired and fired-up. Start with [Episode 233: Get More Time in a Day, Increase Your Focus, and Accomplish All of Your Goals](https://seanwes.com/podcast/233-get-more-time-in-a-day-increase-your-focus-and-accomplish-all-of-your-goals).

### 4. [99% Invisible](https://99percentinvisible.org)

Look around. Everything you see…yeah, someone designed that. Whether it’s a city or a plastic straw, they all have a lurking history. 99% Invisible explores these often unseen and ignored aspects of design all around us. Listen to [Episode 110: Structural Integrity](https://99percentinvisible.org/episode/structural-integrity) about an undergraduate student narrowly saving the Citicorp Center from collapse!

### 5. [Breakaway Ministries](https://www.breakawayministries.org)

Breakaway is a Christian ministry for students at Texas A&M. I discovered their podcast during college when someone recommended their series on singleness and dating. Suffice to say, Breakaway reignited my passion for the Gospel and desire for a close relationship with Christ …and the messages continue to help me to grow in spiritual maturity. I *highly* encourage you to listen to Ben Stuart’s series on Ephesians, *All In*, starting with [In Christ](https://subsplash.com/breakaway/messages/mi/+820d5b5).

### 6. [Darknet Diaries](https://darknetdiaries.com)

Wanna hear what happens when Xbox fans find confidential Xbox development hardware? Or how the USA military launched cyberwarfare on ISIS? Or about a physical penetration test gone wrong? Jack Rhysider of Darknet Diaries captivates and entertains me throughout the day with unbelievable stories like these. Try [Episode 45: XBox Underground](https://darknetdiaries.com/episode/45/)

### 7. [Cedarville University Chapel Message](https://www.cedarville.edu/chapel)

At university I had to attend chapel every day. Alumni mentioned how much they missed it, but I didn’t fully appreciate this till I graduated. I valued chapel at the time (some days), but the hunger is far more pronounced when you’re not worshipping Jesus and studying the Word daily among thousands others. Listening to the podcast on my morning commute isn’t the same, but it’s something. My favorite messages are Dr. White’s and SGA’s—like Campbell Bortel’s on [Daniel 1 & 6, “The Crucible For Trust”](https://www.cedarville.edu/Chapel/Watch/SGA-Chapel--10262018/8KkAhwg9LUeHWfuZ5C4cTg)

### 8. [This American Life](https://www.thisamericanlife.org)

This American Life has been a staple in my listening for a long time. It’s such a well-known show I hardly have to describe it. Each episode contains stories about a theme, ranging from amusing to serious. I appreciate its typical first-person narrative approach. A good episode to start with—one long story on the lighter side—is [Episode 129: Cars](https://www.thisamericanlife.org/513/129-cars).

### 9. [Scratching the Surface](https://scratchingthesurface.fm)

Scratching the Surface is another design-focused podcast, but different. Most design podcasts focus on practice—careers, trends, and industry—which is great, but it’s only half of design. This podcast provides the academic half: design criticism, writing, education, and theory. You’ve gotta be a bit nerdy about design to enjoy it, but I guess I am because I find the interviews, like [Episode 132 with Jenny Odell](https://scratchingthesurface.fm/post/187635812060/132-jenny-odell), really fascinating.

### 10. [The SimpleBits Show](https://show.simplebits.com)

This is the newest pocast I’ve started listening to, but it doen’t feel new. It’s hosted by Dan Cedarholm, the previous host of [Overtime](https://dribbble.com/overtime), and is similar in style to how he hosted Overtime; it feels like the old Overtime rebranded! Dan interviews incredibly talented designers and illustrators from the design community. It’s always inspiring to hear about their process and thoughts on the industry.
